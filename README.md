## Usage:

Open FET.exe anywhere on your computer and following the instructions on screen.

# Notes:
Encryption and Decryption are not reversible. So, make sure you have a backup of your files before you encrypt them.

You cannot recover your files if the exact file is not used for decryption.

If you don't want/have an existing key for encryption, LFES can generate one for you upon encryption.
